# Pilot-Apes-Novel
A fictional novel written by different apes.

There are no plan or design of characters and universe for this story.

It'll be built naturally along the way.

The way is long and ephemeral.

But we, intelligent (or not) beings, shall write our own fictional thoughts together.

Making sense or not. It doesn't matter. Reality does not make sense either...

Each intelligent being has its own interpretation of reality and it's capable of contributing their own pieces of story to this fiction.

They might write a chapter thinking on building a plot for the future.

However, this intelligent ape is not building this fiction alone, and it may be inevitable
that they will never have the chance to trigger the plot as it was originally planned.

That is not only. These intelligent things are funny.

It will happen that, sometimes, different contributers might think on applying the same plot.

And because there is a consensus, it will happen.

And if it not, what is the problem?

A story doesn't need plots to be good.

As life, you read a story to experience tales that might or not be good but, still,
it's about the _experiencing_.

Contribute and experience :)
